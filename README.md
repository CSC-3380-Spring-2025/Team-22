When ready to play, click the play button. This begins the game on Day 1 out of 10. Each day has different resources and aliens that spawn on the tilemap. To check which resources the player has collected, press the **Tab** key on the keyboard. Once the player has collected all resources and battled all enemies, they can click the den and Laika will sleep. Each time Laika sleeps, the next day begins.

By the final the day, she should be strong enough to fight and defeat the final boss, which if defeated, will win the game.
