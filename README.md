# About Our Software

Survival Turn-based RPG Game based on the historical events of Laika, the first animal to orbit the Earth. Stranded on the moon, fight your way through aliens and build a base to survive until you make it home.
Laika is able to collect resources from her environment and from defeated aliens throughout her journey, then craft the raw resources into weapons and tools. As she defeats more aliens, she will gain more HP and learn new moves until she is strong enough to take on the toughest alien in space.
